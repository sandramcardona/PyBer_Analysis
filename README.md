# PyBer_Analysis

## Background
After finalizing the PyBer Analysis, V. Isualize has asked to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type using Python and Pandas. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, to create a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results

### Ride-Sharing Summary DataFrame by City Type

Using Python and Pandas the csv files were merged into one file using the common city column that both files shared. Then the analysis was performed by calculating independtly for each city type (rural, urban and suburban)the total number of rides, total number of drivers, and the total fares for each city type. Then using this values the average fare per ride and average fare per driver for each city type was calculated. Finally, this data was added to a new DataFrame to see the results per city type. Lastly the data in the columns were formatted to be better understood. 



Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
